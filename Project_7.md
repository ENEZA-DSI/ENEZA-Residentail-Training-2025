# Genetic Basis of Coral Symbionts Resilience on the Kenyan Coast

## Abstract

Photosymbiotic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) determine coral thermal tolerance and bleaching sensitivity through their partnerships with coral hosts. 
The diversity and functional role of Symbiodinium clades in Kenyan corals are not well understood, especially in the face of repeated bleaching events. Understanding which
symbionts are associated with thermotolerance could inform coral restoration and assisted evolution strategies in the WIO. Coral reefs along the Kenyan coast face accelerating 
degradation due to climate change induced by marine heatwaves and local anthropogenic stressors. These stressors are caused by both environmental such as climate change and 
human-induced factors such as pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Rising sea surface temperature trends 0.86°C anomalies in 2016 directly cause bleaching by
disrupting coral-algal symbiosis, leaving corals vulnerable to starvation and disease. Despite global advances in coral genomics, Kenyan reefs in Shimoni lack sufficient 
data on genetic diversity of Symbiodinium clades such as the thermally tolerant D1 types observed in Tanzanian Seriatopora hystrix (Chauka et al., AJOL 2016). 
This is also the case for the data on host-symbiont genotype interactions influencing bleaching thresholds (Bove et al., 2022). There is a crucial need to address the
knowledge gap regarding the genetic diversity of coral symbionts and host-symbiont genotype interaction influencing bleaching status of coral reefs that are undergoing
restoration efforts. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the composition dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae associated with Acropora, Porites,
and Stylophora coral genera cultivated at Shimoni, South Coast of Kenya, by the REEFolution Foundation.

## Main Objective

To elucidate the genetic basis underlying the resilience of coral symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) inhabiting reefs along the Kenyan coast.

## Specific objectives
1. To assess the taxonomic annotation of the algae symbionts in coral species
2. To assess the evolutionary relationship of the algae symbionts in coral species
3. To characterize the algae symbionts within coral species
4. To compare the genetic structure of the symbiont community of bleached and unbleached coral reefs within Shimoni in Kenyan coast.

## Metadata

This experiment represented 10 coral species, including Acropora formosa, Acropora tenuis, Acropora spp., Acropora microphthalma, Acropora verweyi, Pocillopora damicornis, Pocillopora verrucosa, Porites cylindrica, Stylophora pistillata, and Stylophora subseriata.
From our metadata, we have sample experiments on coral symbionts to compare bleached and non bleached coral states to understand the effects of environmental stressors,also differentiate corals from subtidal and intertidal zones to assess how varying exposure to environmental fluctuations influences symbiont communities and coral resilience. Techniques such as mineral accretion experiments evaluate the skeletal growth and calcification rates which are closely linked to symbiont photosynthesis and host health. Additionally, coral gardening methods involve fragmenting coral colonies and culturing microcolonies under controlled conditions to promote growth and symbiont acquisition, facilitating reef restoration efforts. These approaches collectively enable detailed investigations into the physiological and molecular dynamics of coral–dinoflagellate symbiosis under varying environmental and experimental setups
We have 418 sample sequence data to work on, which comprises 209 reverse fastq reads and 209 forward fastq reads.
