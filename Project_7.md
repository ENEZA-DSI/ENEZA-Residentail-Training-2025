# Genetic Basis of Coral Symbionts Resilience on the Kenyan Coast

## Abstract

Photosymbiotic dinoflagellates (family Symbiodiniaceae) determine coral thermal tolerance and bleaching sensitivity through their partnerships with coral hosts. 
The diversity and functional role of Symbiodinium clades in Kenyan corals are not well understood, especially in the face of repeated bleaching events. Understanding which
symbionts are associated with thermotolerance could inform coral restoration and assisted evolution strategies in the WIO. Coral reefs along the Kenyan coast face accelerating 
degradation due to climate change induced by marine heatwaves and local anthropogenic stressors. These stressors are caused by both environmental such as climate change and 
human-induced factors such as pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Rising sea surface temperature trends 0.86Â°C anomalies in 2016 directly cause bleaching by
disrupting coral-algal symbiosis, leaving corals vulnerable to starvation and disease. Despite global advances in coral genomics, Kenyan reefs in Shimoni lack sufficient 
data on genetic diversity of Symbiodinium clades such as the thermally tolerant D1 types observed in Tanzanian Seriatopora hystrix (Chauka et al., AJOL 2016). 
This is also the case for the data on host-symbiont genotype interactions influencing bleaching thresholds (Bove et al., 2022). There is a crucial need to address the
knowledge gap regarding the genetic diversity of coral symbionts and host-symbiont genotype interaction influencing bleaching status of coral reefs that are undergoing
restoration efforts. This study aims to address this gap by evaluating the composition dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae associated with Acropora, Porites,
and Stylophora coral genera cultivated at Shimoni, South Coast of Kenya, by the REEFolution Foundation.
