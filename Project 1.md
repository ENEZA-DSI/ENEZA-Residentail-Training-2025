# Decoding the Gut Microbiota of *Phlebotomus* (Sand Flies): A Metagenomic Approach to Vector Control

## Abstract

**Phlebotomus* (sand flies) are important vectors of Leishmania parasites and other pathogens, posing significant public health challenges in Africa, Asia, and Europe. 
Traditional vector control strategies have proven insufficient due to the cryptic behavior and resistance potential of these insects. Recent advances in metagenomics provide a new avenue
for disease control by exploring the microbial communities that colonize sand fly guts. The gut microbiota can influence parasite development and vector competence, offering opportunities
for microbiome-based interventions such as paratransgenesis, symbiont manipulation, and microbial surveillance. This study aims to characterize the microbiome of diverse Phlebotomus species
under different feeding conditions to identify microbial candidates and biomarkers relevant for innovative, non-chemical vector control strategies.

## Research Objectives

1.	To characterize the gut microbiome composition of different Phlebotomus species under plant-fed, blood-fed, and unfed conditions using metagenomic sequencing.
   
2.	To identify bacterial taxa associated with enhanced or reduced Leishmania survival in the sand fly gut, with potential applications in paratransgenesis.
   
3.	To explore microbial biomarkers for vector surveillance and environmental interventions targeting microbiome disruption as a novel vector control strategy.

## Datasets

The available dataset comprises five pools of *Phlebotomus* (sand flies) representing different species, feeding conditions, and origins. Pool 1 contains plant-fed wild-caught female *Ph. mireillae*, while 
Pool 2 includes plant-fed wild-caught female *Ph. guggisbergi.* Pool 3 consists of blood-fed wild-caught female *Ph. mireillae,* providing a comparison between blood and plant feeding within the same species. 
Pool 4 serves as a negative control, comprising *Ph. guggisbergi* that had no plant or blood feeding and no exposure to Leishmania, offering a baseline for microbial composition unaffected by feeding or infection. 
Finally, Pool 5 features blood-fed, lab-reared female *Ph. duboscqi*, enabling the evaluation of microbiome differences between wild and laboratory environments under similar feeding conditions. 
This dataset provides a valuable foundation for investigating how species, feeding status, and environmental origin influence the gut microbiome composition of *Phlebotomus* (sand flies).
